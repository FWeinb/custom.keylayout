# My custom AZERTY `.keylayout` file

This is an edited version of the default ‘French Numerical’ AZERTY keyboard layout available on OS X.

The following special characters are now available through key combinations:

* `⌥` + `i` = `←`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `i` = `→`
* `⌥` + `H` = `♥`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `H` = `♡`
* `⌥` + `2` = `²`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `2` = `³`
* `⌥` + `L` = `λ`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `@` = `☆`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `;` = `‥`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `X` = `×`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `C` = `⌘`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `S` = `⇧`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `O` = `⌥`
* `⌥` + `⇧` + `M` = `−` (minus sign)
* `⌥` + `S` = `∑` (used to be `⌥` + `⇧` + `S`)

## How to install

1. Copy the `.keylayout` file to the `Keyboard Layouts` folder within `/Library` or `~/Library`.
2. Reboot, or log out and log in again.
3. Enable the new keyboard layout via _System Preferences_ › _Language & Text_ › _Input Sources_ › _AZERTY_.

## Notes

Note that I used ‘French Numerical’ instead of the ‘Belgian’ keyboard layout because the only difference between those two is that [the French Numerical layout allows you to type numbers without pressing `Shift` (by enabling `Caps Lock`)](http://superuser.com/questions/138420/typing-numbers-on-a-macbook-pro-with-azerty-keyboard-with-caps-lock-possible).

I’ve only overwritten key combinations that inserted characters that can be inserted by another, easier and more intuitive key combination. For example, to type `ê`, you can either press `^` followed by `E`, or `⌥` + `E`. I’d consider the last one to be obsolete.

Mac OS X has supported `.keylayout` files since version 10.2 (Jaguar).
